chatting application #Damn right

We need read/write access for the repo.
Update: Nevermind

Server: Node.js
FrontEnd: HTML/CSS, Javascript and its libraries 
BackEnd: Node (duh)
DB: MYSQL

Let's go bois!!!!!

Plan:
1) Basic sender/receiver chat system
2) User system and login feature
3) Group chat system
4) Chat message modifications
5) Package the web app with electron.js (Thanks to sudhanshu for mentioning this point. Our project would have been totally lost without this point. He's indeed, the saviour we all needed).

# chat-system
chatting application

We need read/write access for the repo.

Server: Node.js
FrontEnd: HTML/CSS, Javascript and its libraries 
BackEnd: Node
DB: Redis

Plan:
0) Implement custom websocket
1) Basic sender/receiver chat system
2) User system and login feature
3) Group chat system
4) Chat message modifications
5) Package the web app with electron.js (Thanks to sudhanshu for mentioning this point. Our project would have been totally lost without this point. He's indeed, the saviour we all needed).
